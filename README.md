# stateManagement_And_Hooks

## Problem 1 Observation

React simplifies event handling with synthetic events and encourages inline handlers. State management via useState ensures immutability, synchronization with the DOM, and automatic event binding, streamlining UI development and enhancing code readability.

## Problem2 Observation

The dynamic form utilizes React's useState hook for efficient state management, maintaining an array of hobbies as strings. This approach enables dynamic addition and removal of input fields for hobbies, providing a flexible user interface. Each input field corresponds to an element in the hobbies array, ensuring accurate state updates. Users can add new hobbies with the "Add Hobby" button and remove specific hobbies with the "Remove" button next to each input field. The form's submission functionality logs the array of hobbies to the console, showcasing React's capability to handle dynamic forms seamlessly within functional components.
